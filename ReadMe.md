# Canvas Drawing Starter Kit

This project is intended to be a "starter kit" for experimenting with the JavaScript canvas API.

## Installing Node.js

Having Node.js working on your computer is a necessary prerequisite for this project.
I prefer to use its [official installer](https://nodejs.org/), but you can also install Node.js using Homebrew on a Mac, or the package manager of your Linux distribution.

## Getting the code

If you have not already done this:

	git clone https://github.com/perryiv/canvas_drawing_starter_kit.git

## Running with Node.js

Once you have Node.js installed, do this:

	cd canvas_drawing_starter_kit
	npm install
	npm run server

And in a second terminal window, do this:

	cd canvas_drawing_starter_kit
	npm run watch

Load this URL in your favorite browser:

	http://localhost:8080/

Open this file in your favorite text editor:

	canvas_drawing_starter_kit/Source/Draw.js

Any changes to this file, once saved, should automatically reload the browser.
